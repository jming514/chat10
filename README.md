# CPS888 Project: Chat10

## Current functions

A chat server must be first set up before clients can talk. The clients choose an IP and port # to connect to. Multiple clients can connect to a chat server and message each other.

## Information

Client.java and Server.java are the back end files.

ClientGUI2.java and ServerGUI.java are handle all GUI.

## Changes to make

- ClientGUI2.java needs to be connected to Client.java

- ServerGUI2.java needs to be connected to Server.java

## Features to add

- [ ] Show connected users: Clients are able to see what other users are connected to the same chat server they are connected to. The gui should display all users in the chat room.

- [ ] Stored chat history: Chat history should be stored in a database such that new users joining the chat room are able to see previously sent messages even if they were not connected.

- [ ] File transfer: A client can upload file and allow other users in the chat room to download the file.
